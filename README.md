## Exercise 1
The program reads three integer values from an input dialog. The three values represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The program displays a message that states whether the triangle is scalene, isosceles, or equilateral.

## Exercise 2
Design and then Implement an application that creates a histogram from a set of values. The program should read an arbitrary number of integers (in the range 1-100) from an input file and produce a histogram like this one: <br/>
   1 - 10  | ****<br/>
  11 - 20  | *****************<br/>
  21 - 30  | **********<br/>
 31 - 40  | **<br/>
 41 - 50  | ******<br/>
 51 - 60  |<br/>
 61 - 70  | **<br/>
 71 - 80  |<br/>
 81 - 90  |<br/>
 91 - 100 | *<br/>
